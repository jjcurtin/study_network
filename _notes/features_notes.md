## Outcomes

- continuous (prorated counts of lapses during 3-month study period)
    - poisson
    - linear

- binary (lapse vs. non-lapse)
    - lapse (n = 80)
    - non-lapse (n = 64)
*Decision to discard this outcome 10/20/2025*

- binary (high vs. low)
    - high (n = 29)
    - low (n = 115)

## Features

**All feature sets are tuned on raw counts, percentages, and combined.**

- v1: Network features extrated from contacts information

- v2: v1 features with intersections

- v3: Network features extracted from contacts information (without workers)

- v4: v3 features with intersections
